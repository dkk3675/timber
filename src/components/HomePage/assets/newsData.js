    data: "It was a very historic day for Fiji Pine Ltd as landowners of Nabou station lease from Mataqali Nasaqa, Tau Village agreed to renew their land for another 60-year term. There have been numerous attempts in the past which have proven futile, with continuous collaboration and the spirit of inclusiveness, we have managed to achieve this through a round table discussion. It was an emotional moment for both Fiji Pine Limited and our Landowners. We once again sincerely thank the landowners of Mataqali Nasaqa for their confidence in the Pine Industry! We respect our Landowners and will deliver up to their expectations as they are our shareholders.",
